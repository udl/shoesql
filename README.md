# shoesql
A SQL formatter desktop app written in ruby

ShoeSQL is a little desktop app that can format SQL strings so that you don't have to put your precious statements into just any website. (Ever wondered if those admins have logs?)

It's built with https://github.com/shoes/shoes3 and https://github.com/sonota88/anbt-sql-formatter.

## Running the app

Until there is a wrapped version of the application, you need to [download](http://shoesrb.com/downloads/) the appropriate shoes version for your operating system.
After checking out this repository, start shoes and load `shoesql.rb`.
